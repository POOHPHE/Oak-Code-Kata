        <dt>Biomass energy</dt>
            <dd>Biomass energy is a renewable energy source from living or recently living plant and animal materials which can be used as fuel.</dd>
        <dt>Geothermal energy</dt>
            <dd>Geothermal energy is the heat from the Earth. It's clean and sustainable.</dd>
        <dt>Solar energy</dt>
            <dd>Solar energy is radiant light and heat from the Sun that is harnessed using a range of ever-evolving technologies such as solar heating, photovoltaics, solar thermal energy, solar architecture, molten salt power plants and artificial photosynthesis.</dd>
        <dt>Wind energy</dt>
            <dd>Wind energy is a form of solar energy. Wind energy (or wind power) describes the process by which wind is used to generate electricity.</dd>
        <dt>Water energy</dt>
            <dd>Water energy is energy derived from the power of water, most often its motion. Energy sources using water have been around for thousands of years in the form of water clocks and waterwheels. A more recent innovation has been hydroelectricity, or the electricity produced by the flow of water over dams.</dd>
